## Installation
Double click on build.bat
## Running
Run ui.exe from dist folder and click Run button. To stop, click Stop button.
  
 Note: Since laptops don't have any other sensors to obtain the light intensity around you, the webcam will be kept on to obtain the light intensity and adjust the brightness of the screen in realtime. While this adaptive brightness is running you won't be able to control the brightness, it will be automatically adjusted to the light intensity obtained from the webcam.

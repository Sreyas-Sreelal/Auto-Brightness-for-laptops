# Adaptive-Brightness
  This is a simple Python program to automatically adjust the screen brightness of a laptop, using the webcam to obtain the light intensity around the user.

Installation
  1. Clone or download the repository into a new folder.
  2. Open a terminal in that folder and type "python setup.py py2exe" without quotes.
  3. Wait for the process to complete. 

Running
  Run ui.py and click Run button. To stop, click Stop button
  
  
 Note: Since laptops don't have any other sensors to obtain the light intensity around you, the webcam will be kept on to obtain the light intensity and adjust the brightness of the screen in realtime.
